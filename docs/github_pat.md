# GitHub public access token

## To create a classic public access token, follow these steps:

- Go to your GitHub account settings, select Developer settings, then Personal access tokens, then Generate new token (classic).
- Choose a name for your token and the scopes you want to grant to it. The scopes determine what resources and actions the token can access on GitHub.
- Click Generate token and copy the token to your clipboard. You can also view or delete your tokens at any time on the Personal access tokens page.
- Copy and paste the token to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` variable in your .env file.
