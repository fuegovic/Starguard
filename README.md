# Discord-GitHub-bot

## To Do:
- ⛔Remove role if the user validation shows `starred_repo: false`
- 🦋 Make it pretty (organize the slash commands)
- 🪓 Split the user validation commands from the other github menu?
- 😈 add "admin" command to force re-verification and update roles assignments
- 🔎 Implement a periodic check of the starred users or something like that
- 🖲️ Add functions to the bot (<ins>5 buttons max</ins>)
  - example:
